## Problem Statement

Traveling often means fun and relaxation, but its planning can often get stressful when you have little knowledge of the place and too many options to choose from. Many times travelers have through many websites with recommendations, and curate their own list of places, and plan for each day. Our app tries to solve the pain of users that want travel itineraries given a couple of constraints, such as the amount of people travelling. We aim to target from families that travel together, to groups of friends, or individuals going on solo trips.

## User Stories
1. As a parent I want all family members to enjoy the trip so I would want to go somewhere with many different options of food and leisure. I would appreciate it if the website had an option to select a family trip for my family where I can specify the age of my kids for instance and maybe the number of family members that are coming along the trip. I want the whole family (kids, wife/husband, grandparents) to enjoy the trip and have personalized experiences according to their wants and needs.
2. As an elderly I am not too good with technology, so I base my travel plans on books, which are normally outdated. Since I am not too tech savvy, I would appreciate a simple website that gives me direct prompts and quickly generates a list of places for me, with no need for registration or email confirmations.
3. As someone traveling for work, I have limited time to explore the city. Since I don’t know when I will have the opportunity to have some free time, I would like some way to have access to good places in the area of the city I am located at the moment, without having to plan ahead, so I can quickly get to places, as well as the ability to send the finished trip through email if I want to look at it again.
4. As a group of friends planning a trip, we want an app that can suggest activities and attractions suitable for our diverse interests, so that we can create a well-rounded itinerary that satisfies everyone. We want to have plans organized for every single day, so we know what time to wake up and what time we should go to bed.
5. As a solo traveler around the world, I want to be able to have short itineraries for when I hop from city to city, so I can quickly know good places to go and use the most of my time.

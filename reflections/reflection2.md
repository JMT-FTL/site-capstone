## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Build moveable blocks and using image api.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- make the image api work
- fix css of modals (complicated parent-child relationship)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We have to finish working on authentication, and this is the main goal for the backend team this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We didn't use specific resources.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We still have to work on saving itineraries, but i wouldn't classify it as "at risk."

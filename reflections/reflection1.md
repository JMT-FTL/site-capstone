## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We managed to finish the MVP (fullstack). We generate responses from the OpenAI API call, based on what the user inputs on the form. CSS is also done.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Refactor the backend and add API keys to the backend.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished everything.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We used many of our previous projects knwoledge, but we also used resources to understand more of github. The advisors also helped us extensively.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We will begin to work on extra features, especially the saving itineraries features. This one seems to be more complicated, but very much similar to what we did on the lifetracker project. We also want to have a download button for users, which we still don't know how to do.
